"description":"Abstrakta is a dissemination and sharing platform for the upcycling of multidisciplinary, near-time pre-publication research. We turn unused academic research into licensable (non-transferable) NFTs. It’s for everyone– from academics to commercial entities to independent researchers. Abstrakta’s users can share their near-time portfolio and allow for their research “leftovers” to be used in other publications and/or licensed for commercial use, all while being cited for their work and growing their professional reputation. Abstrakta runs on open-source and decentralized principles and it has built-in exploitation resistance through several mechanisms including a dispute resolution protocol and meta and community level governance in which all users have a vote.",
